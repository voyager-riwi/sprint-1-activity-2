📚 C# Lists Practice Project
📌 About

This project was created as part of my programming studies.
The main goal is to practice working with lists in C# through different small applications.
It runs in the console and allows interaction with the user.

⚙️ Features

The program starts with a main menu where you can choose one of four exercises:

1. Grades from a Course:
- Enter multiple student grades (between 1 and 5).
- Shows whether each student passed or failed.
- Displays a message if there are low-performing students.
- Calculates the average grade of the group.

2. Singing Contest
- Add a list of participants.
- Show all participants.
- Find participants whose name starts with "A".
- Perform CRUD operations (Add, Remove, Update participants).

3. Shopping Cart
- Add products with quantity and price.
- Show cart details and calculate total.
- Apply a 10% discount if the total is above 200.
- Perform CRUD operations (Add, Remove, Update products).

4. Employees Management System

- Count employees under 18.
- Show list of employees.
- Perform CRUD operations (Add, Remove, Update employees).
